Here is the explaination of code:
1)Server Creation:

The code uses the http.createServer() function to create an HTTP server object.
This function takes a callback function that will be executed whenever a request is made to the server.
2)Request Handling:

Inside the callback function, the code checks the req.method property to determine the request method (e.g., POST, GET).
It also checks the req.url property to determine the URL being requested.
3)Handling POST Requests:

If the request method is "POST", the code proceeds to handle the request.
It further checks if the URL is "/api/v1/register" or "/api/v1/login" to determine the specific action to be taken.
4)Receiving Request Data:

When a request is made, the code listens for the "data" event on the request object (req.on("data", callback)).
This event is triggered whenever a chunk of data is received as part of the request body.
The code appends the received data chunks to a body variable, converting them to strings using chunk.toString().
5)Handling the End of Data Transmission:

After receiving all the data chunks, the code listens for the "end" event on the request object (req.on("end", callback)).
This event is triggered when all the data has been received.
Inside the event callback, the code performs further processing on the received data.
6)Parsing Request Data:

The received data, stored in the body variable, is parsed as JSON using JSON.parse(body).
This allows the code to access and extract specific data from the request body, such as email and password.
7)Request Validation and Response:

The code performs various checks, such as ensuring the presence of email and password in the request data.
It also checks if a user with the same email and password already exists in the data array.
Based on these checks, appropriate HTTP status codes and response bodies are set using res.statusCode and res.end().
8)Setting Response Headers:

The code sets the "Content-Type" header to "application/json" using res.setHeader("Content-Type", "application/json").
This indicates that the response body will be in JSON format, allowing the client to interpret it correctly.
9)Starting the Server:

Finally, the server starts listening on the specified port (app.listen(PORT)), and a message is logged to the console.
